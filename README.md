Code &amp; documentation for the Minor Class: CSS to the Rescue ðŸŽ‰

## Final Assignment
This is a living styleguide for the class "CSS to the Rescue". Part of the Minor Web Development at the University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam.

**Personal learning goals**
* Work more seamlessy with Flexbox
* Using the right relative unites
* Play around with CSS variables
* Know some more advanced selectors
* Use new :pseude selectors
* Use a respected CSS structure

**Stylesheet Order**

1. Variables
1. Reset
1. Global page styling
1. Tags
1. Attributes
1. Components
1. Media Queries

My personal goal was to mainly get comfortable with all the selectors and declerations so I can do that on automatic pilot. Next time with this knowledge I can focus way more on UX and styling / designing the components to make them look *"pretty"*.ðŸŒˆ
