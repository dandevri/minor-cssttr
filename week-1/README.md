## Week 1
**Goal week 1**

Rather than making things pretty (which is mostly a matter of time) my goal was to work
with some of the CSS secrets, CSS selectors and flexbox which I don't have much experience with.

The page is far from where I want it to be so I am trying to refine it during the weekend.
*It currently is shit ðŸ’©*
